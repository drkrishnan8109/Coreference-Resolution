The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands (GDNF, Neurturin [NTN], and Persephin [PSP]) signal through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a high-affinity binding component (GFRalpha1-GFRalpha4) and a common signaling component (RET).
 Here, we report the identification of Artemin, a novel member of the GDNF family, and demonstrate that it is the ligand for the former orphan receptor GFRalpha3-RET.
 Artemin is a survival factor for sensory and sympathetic neurons in culture, and its expression pattern suggests that it also influences these neurons in vivo.
 Artemin can also activate the GFRalpha1-RET complex and supports the survival of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in culture, indicating that like GDNF (GFRalpha1-RET) and NTN (GFRalpha2-RET), Artemin has a preferred receptor (GFRalpha3-RET) but that alternative receptor interactions also occur.
