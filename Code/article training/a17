The steroid hormone ecdysone directs Drosophila metamorphosis via three heterodimeric receptors that differ according to which of three ecdysone receptor isoforms encoded by the EcR gene (EcR-A, EcR-B1, or EcR-B2) is activated by the orphan nuclear receptor USP.
 We have identified and molecularly mapped two classes of EcR mutations: those specific to EcR-B1 that uncouple metamorphosis, and embryonic-lethal mutations that map to common sequences encoding the DNA- and ligand-binding domains.
 In the larval salivary gland, loss of EcR-B1 results in loss of activation of ecdysone-induced genes.
 Comparable transgenic expression of EcR-B1, EcR-B2, and EcR-A in these mutant glands results, respectively, in full, partial, and no repair of that loss.
