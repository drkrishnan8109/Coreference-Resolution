The nmd mouse mutation causes progressive degeneration of spinal motor neurons and muscle atrophy.
 We identified the mutated gene as the putative transcriptional activator and ATPase/DNA helicase previously described as Smbp2, Rip1, Gf1, or Catf1.
 Mutations were found in two alleles-a single amino acid deletion in nmdJ and a splice donor mutation in nmd2J.
 The selective vulnerability of motor neurons is striking in view of the widespread expression of this gene, although the pattern of degeneration may reflect a specific threshold since neither allele is null.
 In addition, the severity of the nmd phenotype is attenuated in a semidominant fashion by a major genetic locus on chromosome (Chr) 13.
 The identification of the nmd gene and mapping of a major suppressor provide new opportunities for understanding mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.
