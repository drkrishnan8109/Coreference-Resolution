To clarify the mechanism for the endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland, we examined the effects of removal of extracellular Ca2+, blockers of L-, N-, P- and Q-types of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCC) such as nifedipine (L-type), omega-conotoxin GVIA (N-type), omega-agatoxin IVA (P-type) and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (Q-type) and blockers of voltage-independent Ca2+ entry channel such as SKF 96365 and LOE 908 on release of catecholamines, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and 45Ca2+ uptake in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.
 ET-1 but not ET-3 induced increases in release of catecholamines, [Ca2+]i, and 45Ca2+ uptake.
 The responses to ET-1 were abolished by the antagonist for ET(A) receptors, BQ-123, but not by the antagonist for ET(B) receptors, BQ-788, and they were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+.
 The increases were only partially inhibited (to about 65% of control) by nifedipine but unaffected by any of the omega-toxins.
 The nifedipine-resistant increase was inhibited by SKF 96365 (to about 40%) and abolished by LOE 908 alone.
 These results indicate that ET-1 augments the release of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells through ET(A) receptors, by activating two types of Ca2+ entry channels in addition to L-type VOCC: one (nonselective cation channel-1; NSCC-1) is sensitive to LOE 908 but resistant to SKF 96365, whereas the other (NSCC-2) is sensitive to both LOE 908 and SK&F 96365.
