p27Kip1 is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.
 It binds to a variety of cyclin/CDK complexes, inhibits kinase activity, and blocks the cell cycle.
 Absent or reduced p27 expression has been shown to be a significant predictor of poor survival in breast, colorectal, prostate, non-small cell lung and esophagus carcinomas.
 An immunohistochemical assay was performed on 169 patients with primary breast cancers to evaluate the biologic significance of p27 expression.
 Decreased p27 expression was significantly associated with high grade (P = 0.
00025), negative estrogen receptor (P = 0.
00004), and negative progesterone receptor (P = 0.
0038) breast cancers.
 Univariate analysis reveals that p27 expression inversely correlated significantly with overall survival (P = 0.
0001).
 By multivariate analysis, p27 predicted the overall survival independently (P = 0.
0096).
 Our study indicates that p27 expression is an independent prognostic marker of breast cancer in Taiwan.
