Inotropic effects on isolated neonatal and adult mouse myocardium of endothelin I and angiotensin II were examined.
 Endothelin I produced a sustained positive inotropic response in the neonate but a sustained negative response in the adult.
 Both were concentration-dependent and were inhibited by the endothelin ETA receptor antagonist, BQ-123 (Cyclo(D-a-aspartyl-L-prolyl-D-valyl-L-leucyl-D-tryptophyl)).
 Angiotensin II produced a sustained positive inotropic response in the neonate while a sustained negative response in the adult.
 Both were concentration-dependent and were inhibited by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, YM358 (2,7-diethyl-5-((2'-(1 H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl-5H-pyrazolo(1,5-b)(1,2,4)tria zole potassium salt monohydrate).
 These results indicate that inotropic responses of the mouse heart to cardioactive peptides are unique among experimental animal species and may be reversed during development.
