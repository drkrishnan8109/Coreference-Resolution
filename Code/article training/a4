In myocardial cells (MCs), endothelin-1 (ET-1) exerts various effects such as hypertrophy, and causes cellular injury.
 Long-term treatment with an endothelin-A (ET(A)) receptor antagonist improves the survival of rats with heart failure, suggesting that myocardial endothelin system contributes to the progression of heart failure.
 p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) is a member of the MAPK family and activated by several forms of environmental stresses.
 We show here the effect of ET-1 on p38 MAPK activation and the role of ET-1-activated p38 MAPK on morphological changes in MCs.
 ET-1-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation was detectable within 2 min and maximal at 5 min and was concentration dependent.
 The maximum effect was obtained at 10 nM.
 An ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ-123, but not an endothelin-B receptor antagonist, BQ-788, inhibited 
these reactions.
 A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, failed to inhibit the morphological changes associated with ET-1-induced myocardial cell hypertrophy.
 These results indicate that p38 MAPK is activated by ET-1 but does not contribute to the development of ET-1-induced myocardial cell hypertrophy.
